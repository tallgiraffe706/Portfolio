                <p class="text-light">After seeing the official Berkshire Hathaway website, I knew it needed a redesign.</p>

                <p class="text-light">
                    <br>The original website can be found <a href="https://berkshirehathaway.com/">here</a>. My redesign of the website can be 
                    found <a href="berkshire_hathaway.html">here</a>.
                </p class="text-light">

                <h3 class="text-light">The Website</h3>
                <p class="text-light">The official Berkshire Hathaway website, which can be found <a href="https://berkshirehathaway.com/">here</a> is extremely bare bones. 
                    When trying to navigate the site, I had trouble finding any logical flow or organization to the 
                    way the content was laid out.

                <h3 class="text-light">The Problems</h3>
                <h4 class="text-light">Usability Problems</h4>
                <ul class="text-light">
                    <li>
                        The website is not very memorable. Aside from the header at the top, there is nothing in particular that stands 
                        out to me.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In terms of efficiency, the website has almost nothing to load so it is very efficient with load time. However, 
                        it is not very efficient to use because there is no structure or order to the elements on the site, so it takes 
                        a while to find what you are looking for.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The website is somewhat learnable, in that someone who uses it quite often would eventually know what all the 
                        links are, but it takes quite a while to learn without a logical separation or grouping of the items.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I donâ€™t understand the point of the Geico advertisement at the bottom of the page as it seems extremely unrelated 
                        and randomly placed there.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="text-light">Accessibility Problems</h4>
                <p class="text-light">
                    There were not too many errors and mistakes found on this website. I believe this is due to the extremely bare status of 
                    the site, where there are enough structural elements for many mistakes to have been made. The main error that was found 
                    was that the language was not defined in the code. Additionally, there was a redundant link, meaning that two of the links 
                    linked to the same page. There were also links to PDF documents, which can decrease the accessibility of the site since 
                    PDF documents sometimes need a separate application in order to be read. Finally, there were some areas on the website 
                    where the text was too small making it difficult to read.

                <h3 class="text-light">The Redesign</h3>
                <h4 class="text-light">Lo-Fi Wireframes</h4>
                <p class="text-light">
                    Before creating the redesigned webpage, it was important for me to create some low fidelity wireframes of what I intended 
                    for the page. This way, I would have some guiding design principles for all the different devices I was designing for. 
                    These wireframes helped map out the basic elements of the page. They can be found below:

                <h4 class="text-light">Hi-Fi UI Style Guide</h4>

                <p class="text-light">
                    After creating the low fidelity wireframes, I needed to create more realistic high fidelity prototypes. For these, I would need 
                    a better idea of the color palette I would be drawing from to unify my webpage. For this purpose, I created a UI Style Guide, 
                    which can be found below:
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-light">Hi-Fi Prototypes</h4>
                <p class="text-light">
                    Finally, I created the high fidelity prototypes for the redesigned webpage. These prototypes are the true guide that I used 
                    for creating the real redesign for the website, as they are much higher quality than the lo-fi wireframes, and they are 
                    annotated with notes about how to design certain elements to achieve a specific look. I created three prototypes, one for 
                    a computer monitor, one for a tablet, and one for a phone. The hi-fi prototypes can be found below:

                <h4 class="text-light">The Final Webpage</h4>
                <p class="text-light">
                    With the guide of the hi-fi prototypes, I was able to complete the final redesign of the webpage. The redesign can be found
