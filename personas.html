                    I was curious about the effectiveness of the design of one of my speakers. I remembered having a difficult
                    time understanding how to use it when I first bought it, and I wanted to see if others' experiences with 
                    the speaker would mirror my own.

                <h3 class="text-light">The Interface</h3>
                <p class="text-light">
                    The interface in question is the Coleman CBT50 portable bluetooth speaker. A sketch of the speaker can be 
                    found below. The interface consists of a total of 3 buttons and a switch. The three buttons on the top 
                    are used for the Skip-Backward, Play/Pause, and Skip-Forward operations. The switch, located on the 
                    bottom of the speaker, is used primarily for turning the speaker On and Off, along with setting it to 
                    pairing mode.

                <h3 class="text-light">The Experiment</h3>
                <p class="text-light">
                    In order to better understand other people's interactions with the bluetooth speaker interface, I designed 
                    a set of interview questions that would help capture the users' experiences. My plan was to bring the 
                    speaker to a party and observe as different people tried connecting their respective phones to the speaker. 
                    Once each user had finished interacting with the speaker, I interviewed them in an attempt to capture the 
                    parts of the interface interaction that had stuck out to them. My interview questions can be found below:

                <h3 class="text-light">The Observations</h3>
                <p class="text-light">
                    Overall, all three users took some time initially to figure out how to turn the speaker on. Two users 
                    spent about a minute repeatedly pressing the play button at the top and checking their phones to see if 
                    that had turned the speaker on and made it available to pair. The third user tried pressing all the 
                    buttons at the top of the speaker (play, skip-forward, skip-backward) to turn on the speaker. After about 
                    a minute of playing around with the speaker, all users were able to find the power switch at the bottom of 
                    the speaker. Once each person figured out how to turn the speaker on, the connection process was similar 
                    for the first two users as the speaker audibly went into pairing mode and they were able to connect to it 
                    via the bluetooth screen on their respective phones. The third user was able to get the speaker into 
                    pairing mode, but as they went to connect via their phone, the speaker ran out of battery. This user spent 
                    the next few minutes trying to figure out what was wrong with the speaker after he was unable to connect, 
                    and eventually got frustrated and gave up.

                        <ul type='disc'>

                                Users described the experience of connecting their phones to the speaker as hard, and they 
                                experienced difficulties when interacting with the speaker’s interface.

                            <li>
                                Generally, users’ biggest challenge was figuring out how to get the speaker to power up and 
                                get into pairing mode.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                One user felt the most significant challenge was understanding the status of the speaker, 
                                as it had run out of charge while they tried to connect.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul type='disc'>
                            <li>
                                Generally, users felt the change would be to move the power switch to the top of the speaker 
                                so it is more accessible.
                            </li>
