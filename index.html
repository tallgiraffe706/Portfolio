            <p>
                I was curious about the effectiveness of the design of one of my speakers. I remembered having a difficult
                time understanding how to use it when I first bought it, and I wanted to see if others' experiences with 
                the speaker would mirror my own.
            </p>

            <h3>The Interface</h3>
            <p>
                The interface in question is the Coleman CBT50 portable bluetooth speaker. A sketch of the speaker can be 
                found below. The interface consists of a total of 3 buttons and a switch. The three buttons on the top 
                are used for the Skip-Backward, Play/Pause, and Skip-Forward operations. The switch, located on the 
                bottom of the speaker, is used primarily for turning the speaker On and Off, along with setting it to 
                pairing mode.
            </p>

            <h3>The Experiment</h3>
            <p>
                In order to better understand other people's interactions with the bluetooth speaker interface, I designed 
                a set of interview questions that would help capture the users' experiences. My plan was to bring the 
                speaker to a party and observe as different people tried connecting their respective phones to the speaker. 
                Once each user had finished interacting with the speaker, I interviewed them in an attempt to capture the 
                parts of the interface interaction that had stuck out to them. My interview questions can be found below:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>
                    Which of these 4 statements best describes your experience with connecting your phone to the bluetooth 
                    speaker?

                    <ol type='a'>
                        <li>
                            Connecting my phone to the bluetooth speaker was easy and I encountered no difficulties.

                        <li>
                            Connecting my phone to the bluetooth speaker was somewhat easy but I was slightly 
                            confused and encountered some difficulties.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Connecting my phone to the bluetooth speaker was hard and I had significant difficulties 
                            with the interface.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I was not able to connect my phone to the bluetooth speaker. The interface was too difficult 
                            to understand.

                    If you were given the opportunity to change one thing about the design of the speaker, what would you 
                    change?

                    <ol type='a'>

                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>The Observations</h3>
            <p>
                Overall, all three users took some time initially to figure out how to turn the speaker on. Two users 
                spent about a minute repeatedly pressing the play button at the top and checking their phones to see if 
                that had turned the speaker on and made it available to pair. The third user tried pressing all the 
                buttons at the top of the speaker (play, skip-forward, skip-backward) to turn on the speaker. After about 
                a minute of playing around with the speaker, all users were able to find the power switch at the bottom of 
                the speaker. Once each person figured out how to turn the speaker on, the connection process was similar 
                for the first two users as the speaker audibly went into pairing mode and they were able to connect to it 
                via the bluetooth screen on their respective phones. The third user was able to get the speaker into 
                pairing mode, but as they went to connect via their phone, the speaker ran out of battery. This user spent 
                the next few minutes trying to figure out what was wrong with the speaker after he was unable to connect, 
                and eventually got frustrated and gave up.
            </p>

            <h3>The Interviews</h3>
            <p>
                Below are the summarized important points from the various interviews I conducted. These are meant to 
                highlight the general patterns between the experiences of different users.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Which of these 4 statements best describes your experience with connecting your phone to the bluetooth 
                    speaker?

                    <ul type='disc'>
                        <li>
                            Users described the experience of connecting their phones to the speaker as hard, and they 
                            experienced difficulties when interacting with the speaker’s interface.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    What was the biggest challenge you faced when connecting your phone to the bluetooth speaker?
                    <ul type='disc'>
                        <li>
                            Generally, users’ biggest challenge was figuring out how to get the speaker to power up and 
                            get into pairing mode.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            One user felt the most significant challenge was understanding the status of the speaker, 
                            as it had run out of charge while they tried to connect.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you were given the opportunity to change one thing about the design of the speaker, what would you 
                    change?
                    <ul type='disc'>
                        <li>
                            Generally, users felt the change would be to move the power switch to the top of the speaker 
                            so it is more accessible.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>The Personas</h3>
            <p>
                Below are the personas I developed representing potential users of the bluetooth speaker based upon my 
                observations of the various users' interactions with the speaker.

            <h1>Redesign Project</h1>
        </div>
        <div class='project-content'>
            <p>After seeing the official Berkshire Hathaway website, I knew it needed a redesign.</p>

            <h3>The Website</h3>
            <p>The official Berkshire Hathaway website, which can be found <a href="https://berkshirehathaway.com/">here</a> is extremely bare bones. 
                When trying to navigate the site, I had trouble finding any logical flow or organization to the 
                way the content was laid out. 
            </p>

            <img src="images/berkshire_original.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway Website">

            <h3>The Problems</h3>
            <h4>Usability Problems</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The website is not very memorable. Aside from the header at the top, there is nothing in particular that stands 
                    out to me.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In terms of efficiency, the website has almost nothing to load so it is very efficient with load time. However, 
                    it is not very efficient to use because there is no structure or order to the elements on the site, so it takes 
                    a while to find what you are looking for.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The website is somewhat learnable, in that someone who uses it quite often would eventually know what all the 
                    links are, but it takes quite a while to learn without a logical separation or grouping of the items.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I don’t understand the point of the Geico advertisement at the bottom of the page as it seems extremely unrelated 
                    and randomly placed there.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Accessibility Problems</h4>
            <p>
                There were not too many errors and mistakes found on this website. I believe this is due to the extremely bare status of 
                the site, where there are enough structural elements for many mistakes to have been made. The main error that was found 
                was that the language was not defined in the code. Additionally, there was a redundant link, meaning that two of the links 
                linked to the same page. There were also links to PDF documents, which can decrease the accessibility of the site since 
                PDF documents sometimes need a separate application in order to be read. Finally, there were some areas on the website 
                where the text was too small making it difficult to read.
            </p>

            <h3>The Redesign</h3>
            <h4>Lo-Fi Wireframes</h4>
            <p>
                Before creating the redesigned webpage, it was important for me to create some low fidelity wireframes of what I intended 
                for the page. This way, I would have some guiding design principles for all the different devices I was designing for. 
                These wireframes helped map out the basic elements of the page. They can be found below:
            </p>
            <img class='prototypes' src="images/BerkshireHathawayMonitorWireframe.png" alt="Lo-Fi Wireframe for Berkshire Hathaway webpage monitor view">
            <img class='prototypes' src="images/BerkshireHathawayTabletWireframe.png" alt="Lo-Fi Wireframe for Berkshire Hathaway webpage tablet view">
            <img class='prototypes' src="images/BerkshireHathawayPhoneWireframe.png" alt="Lo-Fi Wireframe for Berkshire Hathaway webpage phone view">

            <h4>Hi-Fi UI Style Guide</h4>

            <p>
                After creating the low fidelity wireframes, I needed to create more realistic high fidelity prototypes. For these, I would need 
                a better idea of the color palette I would be drawing from to unify my webpage. For this purpose, I created a UI Style Guide, 
                which can be found below:
            </p>

            <img class='prototypes' src="images/ui_style_guide.png" alt="UI Style Guide for Redesigned Berkshire Hathaway webpage">

            <h4>Hi-Fi Prototypes</h4>
            <p>
                Finally, I created the high fidelity prototypes for the redesigned webpage. These prototypes are the true guide that I used 
                for creating the real redesign for the website, as they are much higher quality than the lo-fi wireframes, and they are 
                annotated with notes about how to design certain elements to achieve a specific look. I created three prototypes, one for 
                a computer monitor, one for a tablet, and one for a phone. The hi-fi prototypes can be found below:
            </p>

            <img class='prototypes' src="images/hifi-phone.png" alt="Hi-Fi Prototype for Berkshire Hathaway webpage phone view">


            <h4>The Final Webpage</h4>
            <p>
                With the guide of the hi-fi prototypes, I was able to complete the final redesign of the webpage. The redesign can be found
                <a href="berkshire_hathaway.html">here</a>. Screenshots of it can be found below:
